- `docs/squads/squads-spec.md`
- `ui/src/pages/AgentDetail.tsx`

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the product and UI plan for skill management in Slaw.

The goal is to make skills understandable and manageable in the website without pretending that all adapters behave the same way.

This plan assumes:

- `SKILL.md` remains Agent Skills compatible
- `skills.sh` compatibility is a V1 requirement
- Slaw squad import/export can include skills as package content
- adapters may support persistent skill sync, ephemeral skill mounting, read-only skill discovery, or no skill integration at all

## 2. Current State

There is already a first-pass agent-level skill sync UI on `AgentDetail`.

Today it supports:

- loading adapter skill sync state
- showing unsupported adapters clearly
- showing managed skills as checkboxes
- showing external skills separately
- syncing desired skills for adapters that implement the new API

Current limitations:

1. There is no squad-level skill library UI.
2. There is no package import flow for skills in the website.
3. There is no distinction between skill package management and per-agent skill attachment.
4. There is no multi-agent desired-vs-actual view.
5. The current UI is adapter-sync-oriented, not package-oriented.
6. Unsupported adapters degrade safely, but not elegantly.

## 2.1 V1 Decisions

For V1, this plan assumes the following product decisions are already made:

1. `skills.sh` compatibility is required.
2. Agent-to-skill association in `AGENTS.md` is by shortname or slug.
3. Squad skills and agent skill attachments are separate concepts.
4. Agent skills should move to their own tab rather than living inside configuration.
5. Squad import/export should eventually round-trip skill packages and agent skill attachments.

## 3. Product Principles

1. Skills are squad assets first, agent attachments second.
2. Package management and adapter sync are different concerns and should not be conflated in one screen.
3. The UI must always tell the truth about what Slaw knows:
   - desired state in Slaw
   - actual state reported by the adapter
   - whether the adapter can reconcile the two
4. Agent Skills compatibility must remain visible in the product model.
5. Agent-to-skill associations should be human-readable and shortname-based wherever possible.
6. Unsupported adapters should still have a useful UI, not just a dead end.

## 4. User Model

Slaw should treat skills at two scopes:

### 4.1 Squad skills

These are reusable skills known to the squad.

Examples:

- imported from a GitHub repo
- added from a local folder
- installed from a `skills.sh`-compatible repo
- created locally inside Slaw later

These should have:

- name
- description
- slug or package identity
- source/provenance
- trust level
- compatibility status

### 4.2 Agent skills

These are skill attachments for a specific agent.

Each attachment should have:

- shortname
- desired state in Slaw
- actual state in the adapter when readable
- sync status
- origin

Agent attachments should normally reference skills by shortname or slug, for example:

- `review`
- `react-best-practices`

not by noisy relative file path.

## 4.3 Primary user jobs

The UI should support these jobs cleanly:

1. “Show me what skills this squad has.”
2. “Import a skill from GitHub or a local folder.”
3. “See whether a skill is safe, compatible, and who uses it.”
4. “Attach skills to an agent.”
5. “See whether the adapter actually has those skills.”
6. “Reconcile desired vs actual skill state.”
7. “Understand what Slaw knows vs what the adapter knows.”

## 5. Core UI Surfaces

The product should have two primary skill surfaces.

### 5.1 Squad Skills page

Add a squad-level page, likely:

- `/squads/:squadId/skills`

Purpose:

- manage the squad skill library
- import and inspect skill packages
- understand provenance and trust
- see which agents use which skills

#### Route

- `/squads/:squadId/skills`

#### Primary actions

- import skill
- inspect skill
- attach to agents
- detach from agents
- export selected skills later

#### Empty state

When the squad has no managed skills:

- explain what skills are
- explain `skills.sh` / Agent Skills compatibility
- offer `Import from GitHub` and `Import from folder`
- optionally show adapter-discovered skills as a secondary “not managed yet” section

#### A. Skill library list

Each skill row should show:

- name
- short description
- source badge
- trust badge
- compatibility badge
- number of attached agents

Suggested source states:

- local
- github
- imported package
- external reference
- adapter-discovered only

Suggested compatibility states:

- compatible
- slaw-extension
- unknown
- invalid

Suggested trust states:

- markdown-only
- assets
- scripts/executables

Suggested list affordances:

- search by name or slug
- filter by source
- filter by trust level
- filter by usage
- sort by name, recent import, usage count

#### B. Import actions

Allow:

- import from local folder
- import from GitHub URL
- import from direct URL

Future:

- install from `squads.sh`
- install from `skills.sh`

V1 requirement:

- importing from a `skills.sh`-compatible source should work without requiring a Slaw-specific package layout

#### C. Skill detail drawer or page

Each skill should have a detail view showing:

- rendered `SKILL.md`
- package source and pinning
- included files
- trust and licensing warnings
- who uses it
- adapter compatibility notes

Recommended route:

- `/squads/:squadId/skills/:skillId`

Recommended sections:

- Overview
- Contents
- Usage
- Source
- Trust / licensing

#### D. Usage view

Each squad skill should show which agents use it.

Suggested columns:

- agent
- desired state
- actual state
- adapter
- sync mode
- last sync status

### 5.2 Agent Skills tab

Keep and evolve the existing `AgentDetail` skill sync UI, but move it out of configuration.

Purpose:

- attach/detach squad skills to one agent
- inspect adapter reality for that agent
- reconcile desired vs actual state
- keep the association format readable and aligned with `AGENTS.md`

#### Route

- `/agents/:agentId/skills`

#### Agent tabs

The intended agent-level tab model becomes:

- `dashboard`
- `configuration`
- `skills`
- `runs`

This is preferable to hiding skills inside configuration because:

- skills are not just adapter config
- skills need their own sync/status language
- skills are a reusable squad asset, not merely one agent field
- the screen needs room for desired vs actual state, warnings, and external skill adoption

#### Tab layout

The `Skills` tab should have three stacked sections:

1. Summary
2. Managed skills
3. External / discovered skills

Summary should show:

- adapter sync support
- sync mode
- number of managed skills
- number of external skills
- drift or warning count

#### A. Desired skills

Show squad-managed skills attached to the agent.

Each row should show:

- skill name
- shortname
- sync state
- source
- last adapter observation if available

Each row should support:

- enable / disable
- open skill detail
- see source badge
- see sync badge

#### B. External or discovered skills

Show skills reported by the adapter that are not squad-managed.

This matters because Codex and similar adapters may already have local skills that Slaw did not install.

These should be clearly marked:

- external
- not managed by Slaw

Each external row should support:

- inspect
- adopt into squad library later
- attach as managed skill later if appropriate

#### C. Sync controls

Support:

- sync
- reset draft
- detach

Future:

- import external skill into squad library
- promote ad hoc local skill into a managed squad skill

Recommended footer actions:

- `Sync skills`
- `Reset`
- `Refresh adapter state`

## 6. Skill State Model In The UI

Each skill attachment should have a user-facing state.

Suggested states:

- `in_sync`
- `desired_only`
- `external`
- `drifted`
- `unmanaged`
- `unknown`

Definitions:

- `in_sync`: desired and actual match
- `desired_only`: Slaw wants it, adapter does not show it yet
- `external`: adapter has it but Slaw does not manage it
- `drifted`: adapter has a conflicting or unexpected version/location
- `unmanaged`: adapter does not support sync, Slaw only tracks desired state
- `unknown`: adapter read failed or state cannot be trusted

Suggested badge copy:

- `In sync`
- `Needs sync`
- `External`
- `Drifted`
- `Unmanaged`
- `Unknown`

## 7. Adapter Presentation Rules

The UI should not describe all adapters the same way.

### 7.1 Persistent adapters

Example:

- Codex local

Language:

- installed
- synced into adapter home
- external skills detected

### 7.2 Ephemeral adapters

Example:

- Claude local

Language:

- will be mounted on next run
- effective runtime skills
- not globally installed

### 7.3 Unsupported adapters

Language:

- this adapter does not implement skill sync yet
- Slaw can still track desired skills
- actual adapter state is unavailable

This state should still allow:

- attaching squad skills to the agent as desired state
- export/import of those desired attachments

## 7.4 Read-only adapters

Some adapters may be able to list skills but not mutate them.

Language:

- Slaw can see adapter skills
- this adapter does not support applying changes
- desired state can be tracked, but reconciliation is manual

## 8. Information Architecture

Recommended navigation:

- squad nav adds `Skills`
- agent detail adds `Skills` as its own tab
- squad skill detail gets its own route when the squad library ships

Recommended separation:

- Squad Skills page answers: “What skills do we have?”
- Agent Skills tab answers: “What does this agent use, and is it synced?”

## 8.1 Proposed route map

- `/squads/:squadId/skills`
- `/squads/:squadId/skills/:skillId`
- `/agents/:agentId/skills`

## 8.2 Nav and discovery

Recommended entry points:

- squad sidebar: `Skills`
- agent page tabs: `Skills`
- squad import preview: link imported skills to squad skills page later
- agent skills rows: link to squad skill detail

## 9. Import / Export Integration

Skill UI and package portability should meet in the squad skill library.

Import behavior:

- importing a squad package with `SKILL.md` content should create or update squad skills
- agent attachments should primarily come from `AGENTS.md` shortname associations
- `.slaw.yaml` may add Slaw-specific fidelity, but should not replace the base shortname association model
- referenced third-party skills should keep provenance visible

Export behavior:

- exporting a squad should include squad-managed skills when selected
- `AGENTS.md` should emit skill associations by shortname or slug
- `.slaw.yaml` may add Slaw-specific skill fidelity later if needed, but should not be required for ordinary agent-to-skill association
- adapter-only external skills should not be silently exported as managed squad skills

## 9.1 Import workflows

V1 workflows should support:

1. import one or more skills from a local folder
2. import one or more skills from a GitHub repo
3. import a squad package that contains skills
4. attach imported skills to one or more agents

Import preview for skills should show:

- skills discovered
- source and pinning
- trust level
- licensing warnings
- whether an existing squad skill will be created, updated, or skipped

## 9.2 Export workflows

V1 should support:

1. export a squad with managed skills included when selected
2. export an agent whose `AGENTS.md` contains shortname skill associations
3. preserve Agent Skills compatibility for each `SKILL.md`

Out of scope for V1:

- exporting adapter-only external skills as managed packages automatically

## 10. Data And API Shape

This plan implies a clean split in backend concepts.

### 10.1 Squad skill records

Slaw should have a squad-scoped skill model or managed package model representing:

- identity
- source
- files
- provenance
- trust and licensing metadata

### 10.2 Agent skill attachments

Slaw should separately store:

- agent id
- skill identity
- desired enabled state
- optional ordering or metadata later

### 10.3 Adapter sync snapshot

Adapter reads should return:

- supported flag
- sync mode
- entries
- warnings
- desired skills

This already exists in rough form and should be the basis for the UI.

### 10.4 UI-facing API needs

The complete UI implies these API surfaces:

- list squad-managed skills
- import squad skills from path/URL/GitHub
- get one squad skill detail
- list agents using a given skill
- attach/detach squad skills for an agent
- list adapter sync snapshot for an agent
- apply desired skills for an agent

Existing agent-level skill sync APIs can remain the base for the agent tab.
The squad-level library APIs still need to be designed and implemented.

## 11. Page-by-page UX

### 11.1 Squad Skills list page

Header:

- title
- short explanation of compatibility with Agent Skills / `skills.sh`
- import button

Body:

- filters
- skill table or cards
- empty state when none

Secondary content:

- warnings panel for untrusted or incompatible skills

### 11.2 Squad Skill detail page

Header:

- skill name
- shortname
- source badge
- trust badge
- compatibility badge

Sections:

- rendered `SKILL.md`
- files and references
- usage by agents
- source / provenance
- trust and licensing warnings

Actions:

- attach to agent
- remove from squad library later
- export later

### 11.3 Agent Skills tab

Header:

- adapter support summary
- sync mode
- refresh and sync actions

Body:

- managed skills list
- external/discovered skills list
- warnings / unsupported state block

## 12. States And Empty Cases

### 12.1 Squad Skills page

States:

- empty
- loading
- loaded
- import in progress
- import failed

### 12.2 Squad Skill detail

States:

- loading
- not found
- incompatible
- loaded

### 12.3 Agent Skills tab

States:

- loading snapshot
- unsupported adapter
- read-only adapter
- sync-capable adapter
- sync failed
- stale draft

## 13. Permissions And Governance

Suggested V1 policy:

- board users can manage squad skills
- board users can attach skills to agents
- agents themselves do not mutate squad skill library by default
- later, certain agents may get scoped permissions for skill attachment or sync

## 14. UI Phases

### Phase A: Stabilize current agent skill sync UI

Goals:

- move skills to an `AgentDetail` tab
- improve status language
- support desired-only state even on unsupported adapters
- polish copy for persistent vs ephemeral adapters

### Phase B: Add Squad Skills page

Goals:

- squad-level skill library
- import from GitHub/local folder
- basic detail view
- usage counts by agent
- `skills.sh`-compatible import path

### Phase C: Connect skills to portability

Goals:

- importing squad packages creates squad skills
- exporting selected skills works cleanly
- agent attachments round-trip primarily through `AGENTS.md` shortnames

### Phase D: External skill adoption flow

Goals:

- detect adapter external skills
- allow importing them into squad-managed state where possible
- make provenance explicit

### Phase E: Advanced sync and drift UX

Goals:

- desired-vs-actual diffing
- drift resolution actions
- multi-agent skill usage and sync reporting

## 15. Design Risks

1. Overloading the agent page with package management will make the feature confusing.
2. Treating unsupported adapters as broken rather than unmanaged will make the product feel inconsistent.
3. Mixing external adapter-discovered skills with squad-managed skills without clear labels will erode trust.
4. If squad skill records do not exist, import/export and UI will remain loosely coupled and round-trip fidelity will stay weak.
5. If agent skill associations are path-based instead of shortname-based, the format will feel too technical and too Slaw-specific.

## 16. Recommendation

The next product step should be:

1. move skills out of agent configuration and into a dedicated `Skills` tab
2. add a dedicated squad-level `Skills` page as the library and package-management surface
3. make squad import/export target that squad skill library, not the agent page directly
4. preserve adapter-aware truth in the UI by clearly separating:
   - desired
   - actual
   - external
   - unmanaged
5. keep agent-to-skill associations shortname-based in `AGENTS.md`

That gives Slaw one coherent skill story instead of forcing package management, adapter sync, and agent configuration into the same screen.
